    content: `Starting an Airbnb in Jackson, Mississippi can be a profitable venture — but only if you understand the local regulations, market dynamics, and what it takes to stand out. Here's everything you need to know to get started in 2026.

## Jackson, MS Short-Term Rental Regulations

Before listing your property, you need to comply with Jackson's STR requirements:

**Business License & Basic Use Permit (BUP):** All short-term rental operators in Jackson must obtain a business license from the city and a Basic Use Permit from the Planning Department. You'll need to submit parking and floor plans along with neighbor notification documentation.

**Tax Requirements:** Hosts are required to collect and remit a 7% Mississippi state sales tax plus a local tourism tax on all bookings. If you're using platforms like Airbnb, some of these taxes may be collected automatically — but it's your responsibility to verify.

**Zoning Restrictions:** Short-term rentals are not permitted in all areas zoned as residential in Jackson. Before purchasing or converting a property, verify the zoning designation with the City Planning Department.

**Insurance:** Mississippi requires hosts to carry liability coverage of at least $500,000 per incident.

## Understanding the Jackson STR Market

The Jackson short-term rental market has approximately 283 active listings. Here's what the numbers look like:

The average occupancy rate across Jackson STRs is around 52%, with an average daily rate of $133. The average monthly revenue comes in at approximately $10,371 for properties across the board — but there's a wide range. Top-performing properties (top 10%) command nightly rates of $255 or more and earn $4,053+ per month.

**Peak season** is March, while January tends to be the slowest month.

## What Makes Jackson Properties Successful

The properties that perform best in Jackson share a few traits. They highlight the city's unique character — proximity to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, the State Capitol, and the Fondren District with its boutiques and restaurants. They invest in quality amenities: fully equipped kitchens, comfortable outdoor spaces, and high-speed internet are consistently cited by guests.

Professional photography, optimized listings with strategic keyword placement, and dynamic pricing strategies that adjust rates based on demand, events, and seasonality make the difference between average and top-performing properties.

## Should You Self-Manage or Hire a Manager?

Self-managing can work if you live in Jackson and have the time to handle guest communication, cleaning coordination, maintenance, and pricing optimization. But most successful hosts — especially remote owners — find that professional management pays for itself through higher occupancy rates, optimized pricing, and fewer headaches.

A professional property manager typically charges 15-30% of rental revenue but can increase your net income by driving higher occupancy and nightly rates than most self-managed properties achieve.

    content: `Operating a short-term rental in Jackson, Mississippi requires navigating a combination of local ordinances and state-level tax rules. This guide covers everything you need to stay compliant in 2026.

## Required Permits & Licenses

**Business License:** Every short-term rental operator in Jackson must obtain a business license from the city. This involves an annual fee and registration with the city's business licensing department.

**Basic Use Permit (BUP):** In addition to the business license, you need a Basic Use Permit from the Jackson Planning Department. The BUP application requires submission of parking plans, floor plans, and documentation that neighbors have been notified of your intent to operate a short-term rental.

**Rental Certification:** The city maintains a registry of certified short-term rentals. This registration is part of the enforcement framework ensuring operators meet local standards.

## Tax Obligations

Short-term rental hosts in Jackson are responsible for collecting and remitting several taxes:

**State Sales Tax:** Mississippi imposes a 7% sales tax on short-term rental income. This applies to all stays under 30 days.

**Local Tourism/Lodging Tax:** Jackson also requires collection of a local tourism tax on gross rental revenue. The combined tax burden means hosts need to factor approximately 8-10% in taxes into their pricing strategy.

**Important:** While platforms like Airbnb and VRBO may collect and remit some taxes on your behalf, it's the host's responsibility to ensure full compliance. We recommend consulting with a local tax professional to verify your obligations.

## Zoning Requirements

This is where many potential hosts run into issues. Jackson's zoning code restricts short-term rentals in certain residential zones. Before purchasing a property specifically for STR use, or before converting an existing property, you must verify with the City Planning Department that your property's zoning designation permits short-term rental activity.

Areas like Eastover, parts of Fondren, and Belhaven each have their own zoning considerations. Always verify before investing.

## Insurance Requirements

Mississippi requires short-term rental operators to carry liability insurance of at least $500,000 per incident. Standard homeowner's insurance typically does not cover short-term rental activity, so you'll need to either add a rider or purchase a dedicated STR insurance policy.

## Staying Compliant

Regulations can change. Jackson's approach to short-term rentals has evolved over the years, and staying current is essential. Working with a local property management company that monitors regulatory changes can save you from costly compliance issues.

    description:
      "Real data on Airbnb profitability in Jackson, Mississippi — occupancy rates, average daily rates, monthly revenue, and what separates top performers from the rest.",

    content: `The short answer: yes, Airbnb can be profitable in Jackson, MS — but profitability varies dramatically based on property type, location, management quality, and pricing strategy. Here's what the data shows.

## Jackson STR Market by the Numbers

The Jackson, Mississippi short-term rental market includes approximately 283 active listings. Across all properties, the market averages look like this:

**Average occupancy rate:** 52%
**Average daily rate (ADR):** $133
**Average monthly revenue:** approximately $10,371

But averages don't tell the full story. The gap between median and top performers is significant.

## The Performance Gap

**Entry-level properties** (bottom quartile) earn around $82 per night with lower occupancy. These are typically poorly optimized listings with generic photos, no dynamic pricing, and minimal guest communication effort.

**Median properties** generate approximately $1,540 per month at around $119 per night. These represent the typical self-managed listing.

**Strong performers** hit $173+ per night with above-average occupancy.

**Top 10% properties** command $255+ per night and earn $4,053+ monthly. These are the professionally managed, well-optimized listings with strong review histories and dynamic pricing.

## What Drives Profitability

The difference between a median performer and a top-10% property isn't just about the property itself — it's about operations.

**Dynamic pricing** is the single biggest lever. Properties using data-driven pricing tools that adjust rates based on demand, local events, competitor rates, and seasonality consistently outperform those using flat-rate pricing. The difference can be 30-50% more revenue from the same property.

**Professional photography and listing optimization** directly impact search ranking on Airbnb and VRBO. Higher search placement means more bookings without spending more on marketing.

**Guest experience and reviews** create a compounding advantage. Properties with 4.8+ ratings and Superhost status get algorithmic boosts on Airbnb, leading to more visibility and higher-quality bookings.

**Location within Jackson matters.** Properties near attractions like the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, the State Capitol, Fondren District, and Eastover tend to command premium rates due to proximity to demand drivers.

## Seasonality

Jackson's STR market has seasonal patterns to account for. March is typically the peak revenue month, driven by spring events and tourism. January is the slowest period. Properties with dynamic pricing can partially offset seasonality by capturing demand spikes around events like the Jackson State football season, JSU homecoming, and business travel peaks.

## The Management Factor

Professional property management typically costs 15-30% of revenue, but the data consistently shows that well-managed properties generate enough additional revenue to more than offset management fees. Higher occupancy, optimized pricing, better reviews, and fewer operational headaches translate to higher net returns for owners — even after the management fee.

## Bottom Line

Airbnb is profitable in Jackson, MS — but the spread between average and excellent performance is wide. The property owners who treat their STR as a business (or hire someone who does) capture significantly more revenue than those who list and hope for the best.
